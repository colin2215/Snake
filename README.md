# Snake-Game 
Snake is a genre of action video games where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake.The player must keep the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens. It originated in the 1976 two-player arcade video game Blockade from Gremlin Industries where the goal is to survive longer than the other player.
